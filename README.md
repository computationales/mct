Steps of my analysis:

## Steps

### Evaluation

1. Extract ET and precip time series data from global files at FLUXNET sites locations (LandEval and WATCH) `rscript_get_data_fluxnetsites.R`
2. Evaluate ET from LandEval during rain-free periods agains FLUXNET data `rscript_eval_fluxnet2015.R`
3. Apply MCT method to identify CWD events based on SEBS and precipitation from FLUXNET or WATCH (should yield a list of events for each site)
4. Extract SiF time series data from global files at FLUXNET sites locations (time series) `not implemented`
5. Derive k (slope or decay rate of SiF (and observed GPP) vs. CWD and d) at FLUXNET sites locations; try with normalising SiF with PAR
6. Estimate rooting depth from CWD statistics (MCT method) â†’ zroot*
7. Relate k to zroot*

### Application

Do steps 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 for each pixel globally.

## Method evaluation



1. Get ET and precip data for FLUXNET sites and extract from global files (WATCH-WFDEI and LandFlux) at respective sites for comparison: `rscript_get_data_fluxnetsites.R`
2. Evaluate ET during rain-free periods `rscript_eval_fluxnet2015.R`: Creating file `data/df_eval.csv` and with aligned data `data/df_alg__df_dday_aggbydday.Rdata`. This is used to evaluate whether ET products can accurately simulate ET during dry rain-free periods (i.e., whether bias w.r.t. EC measurements shows any relationship to the duration of rain-free periods).
3. Apply MCT method to identify CWD events based on SEBS and precipitation from FLUXNET or WATCH (should yield a list of events for each site)
4. Get SiF data for FLUXNET sites (time series)

**Old:**
- `calibrate_ET.Rmd` replaces old `calib_mct_fluxnet2015.Rmd`
- Run vignette 'splash_fluxnet2015.Rmd' in rsofun repo to prepare input files for FLUXNET 2015 simulations (for PET)
- Run site-scale simulations (done on my laptop)
- Analyse results using `eval_et.Rmd`


## MCT evaluation



## Simulate global optimal rooting depth

- On CX1, run global simulation.
- Calculate optimal rooting zone WHC globally using `rscript_mct_global.R`.
- Create map of *optimal WHC* using `whc_deficit_global.Rmd`.
- Derive WHC per unit depth using HWSD data and create global maps (NetCDF) using `whc_hwsd.Rmd`.
- Given *optimal WHC*, calculate corresponding depth, accounting for soil texture, using `zroot_global.Rmd`.
- Analyse performance using `modobs_zroot_ecosystem.Rmd`.

## Simulate optimal rooting depth at Schenk & Jackson 2002 sites

- (On CX1, run global simulation)
- Calculate optimal rooting zone WHC for each site using `rscript_mct_simsuite.R`.
- Do analyses of modelled versus observed using `mct_sj02_simsuite.Rmd`.

## Other analyses

- EVI as fAPAR: `fapar_max_global.Rmd`

## Analyse RSIP data

- Analyse global rooting depth distribution from the RSIP data (Shersing's individual-level data): `rsip.Rmd`
